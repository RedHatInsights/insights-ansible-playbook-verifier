## Security

Since we are dealing with PGP, you should ensure you aren't including private key material in your commits. We recommend you to install `gitleaks` package and add it to pre-commit or pre-push script. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

gitleaks detect --verbose
make check
make test
make integration
```
